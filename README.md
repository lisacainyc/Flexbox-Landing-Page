# Flexbox-Landing-Page
I created a landing page from scratch using HTML and CSS.

I started by creating all of the HTML elements that we need for the page. I laid out all of the text and images that we'll be using and put them in order.

I then started styling the page from top to bottom, only focusing on font size, font color, button styling, background colors, and creating empty divs when needed. I added more displayable font weights in order to properly style the page. I wrapped the contents of the entire page into a container so I could control the width of the content separately from the section background.

Finally, I went from top to bottom and used flexbox to format the entire page. All of the sections drew upon exercises that we had done previously and I was able to complete the styling according to the design document.
